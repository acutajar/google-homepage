# google-homepage

This project is a re-creation of the standard Google.com homepage. The purpose of this project is to improve my HTML and CSS skills along with additional practice of my git and linux commands.


Things I learned/practiced along the way:

that i dont understand CSS and flexbox but that i'd rather spend the time learning it on a project i actually care about rather than on a clone of a boring webpage.
